## Multi Stage Build Example

This folder holds a simple devcontainer configuration that builds a local multi stages Dockerfile with a devcontainer feature. This is ideal for testing the build pipeline for more advance use cases, especially the extending of the Dockerfile. 

You can start this project via:
```
devpod up ./examples/build-multi-stage
```
