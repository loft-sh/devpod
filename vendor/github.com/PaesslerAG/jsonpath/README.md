JSONPath is a complete implementation of [http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
JSONPath can be combined with a script language. In many web samples it's combined with javascript. This framework comes without a script language but can be easily extended with one. See [example](https://godoc.org/github.com/PaesslerAG/jsonpath#example-package--Gval).

It is based on [Gval](https://github.com/PaesslerAG/gval) and can be combined with the modular expression languages based on gval.
So for script features like multiply, length, regex or many more take a look at the documentation in the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/PaesslerAG/jsonpath).
