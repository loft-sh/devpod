# Tailscale Logs Service

This github repository contains libraries, documentation, and examples
for working with the public API of the tailscale logs service.

For a very quick introduction to the core features, read the
[API docs](api.md) and peruse the
[logs reprocessing](./example/logreprocess/demo.sh) example.
