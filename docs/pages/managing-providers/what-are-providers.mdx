Providers are simple CLI programs that let DevPod create, manage, and run the workspaces requested by the user.
In the simplest form, a provider defines a command to create, delete and connect to a virtual machine in a cloud.

DevPod relies on the provider model in order to allow flexibility and adaptability for any backend of choice.
Providers in DevPod are defined through a `provider.yaml` that defines the necessary options, configuration, binaries and commands needed to handle workspace creation.

See the [Add a provider](./add-provider.mdx) section to learn more about how to add a provider to DevPod.
See [How to develop a provider](../developing-providers/quickstart.mdx) to learn more about how to create your own provider for DevPod.

## Type of providers

There are two types of providers:

* Machine providers
* Non-machine providers

### Machine providers

Machine providers are those who will create and manage a VM for the workspace
selected.
An example of a Machine provider is the AWS Provider, which uses EC2 instances to
run the environment.
These type of providers will also manage the lifecycle of the VM, starting/stopping
and deleting it when needed.

### Non-Machine providers

Non-machine providers are those who will work directly with containers, instead
of using VMs.
An example of this can be the SSH, Kubernetes and Docker providers.
Those providers will **not** create any VMs, but instead directly run the workspace
container on the target.
