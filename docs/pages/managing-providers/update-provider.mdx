To update a provider to its latest version, you can use:

for a provider.

## From GitHub

Similar to adding a provider, you can update via:
```sh
devpod provider update <provider-name> my-org/my-repo
```

If you want to update (or downgrade) a specific version, you can do:
```sh
devpod provider update <provider-name> github.com/my-org/my-repo@v0.2.0
```

## From URL

You can also specify the URL to the `provider.yaml` file, for example:

```sh
devpod provider update <provider-name> http://path/to/my/provider.yaml
```

### From File

Run the following command to update provider `provider-name`:
```sh
devpod provider update <provider-name> ../path-to-updated/provider.yaml
```
