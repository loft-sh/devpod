DevPod will automatically make certain local credentials available inside of the development container through a [credentials helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials).
This allows you to reuse existing local credentials in a safe manner within the development container without explicitly configuring them inside each workspace.
Currently DevPod supports this feature for git credentials and docker credentials.

## Git credentials

DevPod will make https credentials available inside the dev container through a [git credentials helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials). ssh credentials are available through agent-forwarding that will be configured automatically on the ssh configuration for the workspace.

If you don't want DevPod to inject the credentials, you can disable that via the following command for all workspaces:
```
devpod context set-options default -o SSH_INJECT_GIT_CREDENTIALS=false
```

## Docker credentials

DevPod will make docker registry credentials available inside the dev container through a [docker credentials helper](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-helpers). This allows you to pull and push images from and to private registries from within the dev container.

If you don't want DevPod to inject the credentials, you can disable that via the following command for all workspaces:
```
devpod context set-options default -o SSH_INJECT_DOCKER_CREDENTIALS=false
```

## GPG credentials

DevPod will make gpg keys available inside the dev container through an ssh tunnel. This allows you to sign commits from inside the workspace.

If you want DevPod to inject the gpg keys, you must that via the following command for all workspaces:
```
devpod context set-options default -o GPG_AGENT_FORWARDING=true
```

Or when creating a workspace using:

```
devpod up --gpg-agent-forwarding my-workspace
```
