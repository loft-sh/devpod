## Create a Workspace

You can create a workspace either from the DevPod CLI or through the DevPod desktop application. A workspace can be created from a git repository, a local path or a docker container (e.g. `golang:latest`).

Upon successful creation, DevPod will make the development container available through the ssh host `WORKSPACE_NAME.devpod`. Alternatively, DevPod can automatically open the workspace in a locally installed IDE, such as VS Code or Intellij.

:::info
A workspace is defined through a `devcontainer.json`. If DevPod can't find one, it will automatically try to guess the programming language of your project and provide a fitting template.
:::

### Via DevPod Desktop Application

Navigate to the 'Workspaces' view and click on the 'Create' button in the title. Enter the git repository you want to work on or select a local folder.

:::info Add Provider
If you haven't configured a provider yet, DevPod will automatically open the provider modal for you. You can later add providers in the same way by navigating to 'Providers' > 'Add'
:::

You can also configure one of the additional settings:
- **Provider**: The provider to use for this workspace. Cannot be changed later.
- **Default IDE**: The ide to open after successfully creating this workspace. Can be changed later.
- **Workspace Name**: Override the automatically determined workspace name with this option. Cannot be changed later.
- **Prebuild Repository**: A docker image repository such as `ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo` that contains prebuilds for this workspace. DevPod will try to automatically find a fitting prebuild for this workspace in the given repository.

Then press `Create Workspace` to launch the workspace.

:::info
Under the hood, the Desktop Application will call the CLI command `devpod up REPOSITORY`
:::

:::info Note
You can set the location of your devpod home by passing the `--devpod-home={home_path}` flag, 
or by setting the env var `DEVPOD_HOME` to your desired home directory.

This can be useful if you are having trouble with a workspace trying to mount to a windows location when it should be mounting to a path inside the WSL VM.

For example: setting `devpod-home=/mnt/c/Users/MyUser/` will result in a workspace path of something like `/mnt/c/Users/MyUser/.devpod/contexts/default/workspaces/...`
:::

### Via DevPod CLI

Make sure to [install the DevPod CLI locally](../getting-started/install.mdx#optional-install-devpod-cli) and select a provider you would like to host the workspace on (such as local docker) via:
```
# Add a provider if you haven't already
devpod provider add docker
```

#### Git Repository

Run the following command in a terminal to start a new workspace:

```
# Create from git repository
devpod up github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node
```

:::info Private Git Repositories
DevPod will forward git credentials to a remote machine so that you can also pull private repositories.
:::


:::info Multiple workspaces from the same repository
Use the `--id` flag to override the name of the workspace. This allows you to create multiple workspaces from the same repository.
:::

:::info Specify a branch
Devpod supports working on a specific branch, pull request, and SHA commit, using the following format:

For a branch:

`<git-uri>@<branch>`

For a pull request:

`<git-uri>@pull/<pr-number>/head`

For a SHA commit:

`<git-uri>@sha:<commit-id>`
:::

#### Local Path

Run the following command in a terminal to create a new workspace:

```
# Create from a local path
devpod up ./path/to/my-folder
```

DevPod will sync the folder into the remote machine and create a development environment from the `devcontainer.json`.

#### Docker Image

Run the following command in a terminal to create a new workspace from a docker image:

```
# Create from a docker image
devpod up ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo:latest
```

DevPod will create the following `.devcontainer.json`:
```
{
    "image": "ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo:latest"
}
```

## Recreating a workspace

If you are working on the `devcontainer.json` or have pulled changes that affect the development environment, you can recreate a workspace. Recreating a workspace means to apply changes in the `devcontainer.json` or related `Dockerfile` to the development environment. If a prebuild repository is supplied, DevPod will try to find the updated development environment image inside the prebuild repository and if not found will fall back to building it.

When recreating a workspace, changes only to the project path or mounted volumes will be preserved. **All other changes made in the container will be lost.**

### Via DevPod Desktop Application

Navigate to the 'Workspaces' view and press on the 'More Options' button on the workspace you want to recreate. Then press 'Rebuild' and confirm to rebuild the workspace.

### Via DevPod CLI

Run the following command to rebuild an existing workspace:
```
devpod up my-workspace --recreate
```
