This purpose of this page is to outline any known issues with using devpod and provide known workarounds / fixes.

### Utilities not found in PATH

If DevPod Desktop reports that it cannot find utilities in the PATH, you may need to wrap the call in a shell. Something like

```
#! /usr/bin/env sh

exec $SHELL -c 'exec /Applications/DevPod.app/Contents/MacOS/DevPod'
```

### Port forwarding not working when NOT using an ide

DevPod relies on an active SSH session to perform port forwarding to the local host. When running DevPod without an IDE, such as `--ide none`,
an active SSH session needs to be open using `devpod ssh {workspace}`.
