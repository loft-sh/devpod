A [Machine Provider](../managing-providers/what-are-providers.mdx) is responsible for provisioning machines to host your workspace. 
For cloud providers, these machines are typically virtual machines (VMs). DevPod manages the lifecycle of these machines, including creation and deletion of a workspace.

You can directly manage all the machines in the various workspaces using:

```sh
devpod machine
```
