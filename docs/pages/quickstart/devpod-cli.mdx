## Quickstart with DevPod CLI

Make sure you have installed [DevPod CLI](../getting-started/install.mdx#optional-install-devpod-cli) on your system.

### Add a Provider

You can add a provider via (local-docker for example):

```
devpod provider add docker
```

:::info Other providers
For more providers, please take a look at [Add a DevPod Provider](../managing-providers/add-provider.mdx)
:::

### Start a Workspace

Afterwards you can start a workspace via:

```
# Start in VS Code browser
devpod up github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node --ide openvscode

# Start in VS Code
devpod up github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node --ide vscode

# Start without IDE
devpod up github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node --ide none
```

If you have selected an IDE it should popup automatically. If not, you can connect to the workspace manually:

```
ssh MY_WORKSPACE_NAME.devpod
```
