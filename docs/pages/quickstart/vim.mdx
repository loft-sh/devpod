## Quickstart with Vim/Nvim

Make sure you have installed [DevPod](../getting-started/install.mdx) on your system.

### Add a Provider

<AddProvider />

### Start a Workspace with Vim/Neovim

Navigate to 'Workspaces' > '+ Create'. Enter your project url or choose one of the quickstart examples.

A new window appears showing DevPod starting the workspace.
After the workspace was created, you have a two options to start coding in vim:

#### Netrw/SCP

Vim/Neovim allow you to edit remote files using [Netrw](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1075). 
You can connect it either from within vim `:e scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path` or by starting vim with `vim scp://[user@]machine[[:#]port]/path`.
When you open the workspace, the DevPod logs give you the user/machine combination you'll need to connect to the workspace, usually in the format of `WORKSPACE_NAME.devpod` 

#### Spinning up your vim config in the workspace

Since DevPods target environment is a docker container, you can also ssh into it and install your vim/neovim configuration like you would on any new machine.
To connect to the workspace, run the command DevPod gives you after starting the workspace, usually `ssh WORKSPACE_NAME.devpod`.
